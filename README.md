# PMR446callsign

PMR446callsign is a telegram bot writing in Python.

Needs pyhton..., pip, and sqlite3 to be installed on you system.

Tested...it works fine on a Docker Python container. I do see a reason it should not work on similar enviroments or other Python instances.

Replace YOUR TELEGRAM TOKEN with you bot token obtained from Telegram "BotFather"


the "generated_word.db" will be created when you run the script. This is where the call sign are being store.
